We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Explicitly sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers. Words of advice: if your grandmother would disapprove, then donâ€™t do it.</p>
